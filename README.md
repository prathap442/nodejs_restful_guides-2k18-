> Connection With Mongo db
-> To connect to the mongodb from the express app we use mongoose that provides a DSL for connecting from the mongodb to the express frame work 
to handle the operations at a user defined convenient loginc .

> Schema in Mongoose
-> Schemas are not provided by mongodb. By the way the schema is nothing but basically defining a structure to the document when it is being stored into the Database for a Model .


> Models in Mongodb
- Similar to the Tables in the Postgres we have collections in the Mongodb and the And the models that are being used to define the collection a name.

- The documents in a single collection do not need to have the same set of fields and the data type for a field can differ across documents within a collection.

- To change the structure of the documents in a collection, such as add new fields, remove existing fields, or change the field values to a new type, update the documents to the new structure
